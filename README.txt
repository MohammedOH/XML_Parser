Thanks for your interest in this position with Gordian Software's API Integration team.

The next step in the interview process is to complete the exercise below. This is a practical challenge similar to real problems you would solve as part of this team.

Seatmap Availability Exercise:

Our goal is to parse seatmap information from XML files and create a JSON format that our customers can parse so that they can display any airline seatmap by integrating our format.

Desired behavior: 

Input: python seatmap_parser.py [FILENAME]

Output: FILENAME_parsed.json

Description:
Write a python script that parses the XML seatmap files included in this folder (seatmap1.xml, seatmap2.xml) into a standardized JSON format that outputs the seatmap (by row) with the following properties at minimum:
	- Seat/Element type (Seat, Kitchen, Bathroom, etc)
	- Seat id (17A, 18A)
	- Seat price
	- Cabin class
	- Availability

Feel free to include any other properties in your JSON format that you think are relevant.

Please avoid the use of xml to json libraries/tools such as xmltodict, objectify and the like.
